# kickstarter-analysis-
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
## What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
### The succes rate was greater than the failed and canceled rate
## What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
### The success percentage was greater as well in every case and there are no canceled proyects under the "plays" filter
## What are some limitations of this dataset?
### The limitations that I think we have in this situation is that there is not enough data to determine the real cause of failed and canceled projects
## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
### We could use another pivot tables to analyze the success rate by country, currency and deadline
